 Social advertising replies on the influence of peers’ behaviors to promote new products or brands in social networks. The private responses to social advertisements, such as ad clicks, are directly correlated with ad effectiveness. The public responses, such as ad likes, are social cues displayed on ads and diffused in social networks, leading to greater social influence and then more private responses (spillover effects). This paper identifies the effects of social influence - the effects of displaying social endorsements (i.e. friends’ “likes”) on ads, on consumers' public (i.e. liking) and private (i.e. clicking) responses in social advertising, using a large-scale randomized field experiment involving more than 37 million users of WeChat Moments Ads. The experimental evidence demonstrates that social influence in liking is significantly larger than that in clicking, especially when displaying more likes on the ads. Since the degree of influence in clicking does not increase as the number of “likes” displayed on ads, only the first “like” has a significant economic value for social advertisements and influence in liking does not exhibit the spillover effects on clicking. Compared to displaying no like, displaying one “like” causes users relative 37% more likely to click an ad. I also exploit the interaction effects of influence with users’ product expertise and social status and find that normative and informational influence are both stronger in liking than in clicking. This work presents one of the first large-scale experimental evidence on identifying social influence and its economic value in social advertising and exploring the moderating effects of behavioral characteristics on influence.

    Spending on social advertising has increased dramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, large-scale experimental evidence for the lift from social ads focuses almost exclusively on a single product at a time. As a result, we know little about how the effectiveness of social ads varies across product categories, making it difficult for managers to optimize their social advertising strategies. We therefore conducted a randomized field experiment measuring social ad effectiveness across 71 products in 25 product categories among a random sample of more than 37 million users of WeChat Moments Ads. We analyzed this experiment to causally identify the heterogeneous effects of social advertising across products and product categories and to investigate how product characteristics impact social advertising effectiveness. We found some product categories, like food, clothes, and cars, experienced significantly stronger social advertising effectiveness than other categories like financial services and electrical appliances. More generally, we found that status goods, which rely on normative social influence, displayed strong social advertising effectiveness, but that social ads for experience goods, which rely on informational social influence, did not perform any better than their theoretical counterpart search goods. Understanding the heterogeneous effects of social advertising across products will help marketers differentiate their social advertising strategies and enable managers to optimally price social ads. <br/>

    Peer influence is of central importance in social science. The goal of this paper is to identify subgroups where peer influence exerts enhanced effect on users' responses to social advertisements.
Our model characterizes such a subgroup using a set of interpretable rules, constructed from information regarding a user (susceptibility), his/her friend (influence), and their relationship. We present a Bayesian framework for learning a rule set. The Bayesian model consists of a prior to control the size and shape of a rule set and a Bayesian logistic regression to characterize interactions of features, treatment and subgroup membership. We also develop an efficient inference method for learning a MAP model. For this study, we partnered with a world leading mobile social network platform, WeChat, and conducted a large-scale randomized controlled field experiment on WeChat Moments (i.e., newsfeed), on more than 28 million users across 99 ads. Our model showed competitive performance and demonstrated high robustness for different types of product ads. This is the first paper on a machine learning model to identify subgroups with enhanced peer influence in social advertisements across different product categories. This study provides important insights for advertisers to increase the effectiveness of peer influence in propagating new products of different categories in social networks. <br/>

    Social media not only is a new channel to obtain financial market information but also becomes the venue for investors to share and exchange investment ideas. We examine the performance consequences of providing monetary incentive to amateur analysts on social media and its implications for crowd-sourced equity research. We find that monetary incentive is effective in increasing the amount of content outputs but does not lead to better stock recommendations. Additional analysis suggests that monetary incentive results in wider stock and industry coverage, a sign of increased content diversity. This study contributes to the understanding of incentive mechanisms for social media communities in the financial context.<br/>

    Researchers have long studied how to improve B2C e-commerce outcomes for vendors and consumers.  An implicit assumption in this work is that individuals shop online independently.  However, people often shop online with a friend or partner and buy joint goods.  We extend past research by studying collocated collaborative online shopping (COS), in which two or more shoppers communicate face-to-face and synchronously during the shopping experience.  We investigate whether recommendation agents (RAs), which have been shown to be valuable in individual shopping contexts, have similar benefits for collocated COS, and whether that value depends on the restrictiveness of the RA’s design.  RAs have the contradictory potential to both help the shoppers in their COS task and yet hinder their interaction.  We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare the effects of RAs with different levels of user-system interaction restrictiveness on both the COS process (communications) and outcomes (utilitarian and hedonic value).  Our results suggest that interactions with the RA and interactions with one’s partner are both important in COS and that the combined effects can be complex.  Flexible RAs appear to offer the best balance of partner and system effects, making COS more enjoyable and facilitating the exchange of positive social communication. Our study contributes by identifying the impact of social interactions on COS performance and demonstrating the value of process data to understand and theorize RA influence.<br/>
