This study seeks to understand how social influence enhances the effectiveness of social ads through the effects of social cues (i.e., likes) on both public (i.e., liking) and private (i.e., clicking) ad responses. I find that the first social cue significantly increases users’ propensity to both like and click ads, while additional social cues only increase users’ tendency to (purely) like ads, but does not change their propensity to click on them. The discrepancy of the contagion patterns in liking and clicking occurs consistently, whether the social cues come from the friends with more novel information (weak ties) or more trustworthy information (strong ties or high-status friends). However, the additional social cues indeed increase users’ propensity to click on ads if the social cues are created by less-social friends, who are less affected by social influence. This study reveals the dark side of social influence in social advertising: “likes” may not impact clicking if the “likes” are largely driven by previous likes. It seems that individuals are more influenced by their peers in public valuations than in private actions; however, if the social cues are largely driven by social influence, they may not significantly impact individuals’ private actions. The “saying/doing gap” also makes the public peer endorsements (i.e., likes) unreliable as an indicator for social ad engagement (i.e., click rate).

    This study aims to identify the heterogeneous effects of social advertising, measured by the effects of social cues on ad engagement, and to investigate how product characteristics impact social advertising effectiveness. We find that the effects of the social cues on ad engagement are heterogeneous across different products (e.g., a BMW 325 automobile or a Kitchen-Aid blender), product categories (e.g., fashion products or electronics products) and theoretically motivated product types (e.g., search/experience goods or status/non-status goods). More specifically, status goods, which symbolize consumers’ social status and rely on normative social influence (i.e., social conformity), displayed stronger social advertising effectiveness than non-status goods. Social ads for experience goods, which have more product uncertainties and rely more on informational social influence (i.e., social learning) in product decisions, do not perform any better or worse than their theoretical counterpart search goods. The status and expertise of the user displayed in the ad also moderated these effects differently across different products. As a result, products are not created equal in terms of their diffusion through social networks, and normative social influence is more critical than informational social influence for behavioral contagion in social ads. Marketers should differentiate their viral marketing strategies, and platform managers should price social ads differently for different products. </div><br/>

    The goal of this study is develop a machine learning model that identifies user-friend pairs where social cues (i.e., friends’ likes) have enhanced effects on users’ ad engagement, using high-dimensional data. The impact of social cues in social ads is jointly determined by the characteristics of influencers (influence), those influenced (susceptibility) and their relationships. Our model searches for the user-friend pairs exhibiting enhanced effects of social cues. Such pairs are characterized by the interpretable rules constructed from the demographic, behavioral and network characteristics of users, their friends shown in ads and the tie strength and social embeddedness between the users and the friends. Our results on ad engagements for different product categories demonstrate that the enhanced effects of social cues associated with the identified pairs can be much larger than that on the entire population. As a result, targeting the contagious user-friend pairs is an effective strategy to improve social ads’ effectiveness. </div> <br/>

    Social media not only is a new channel to obtain financial market information but also becomes the venue for investors to share and exchange investment ideas. We examine the performance consequences of providing monetary incentive to amateur analysts on social media and its implications for crowd-sourced equity research. We find that monetary incentive is effective in increasing the amount of content outputs but does not lead to better stock recommendations. Additional analysis suggests that monetary incentive results in wider stock and industry coverage, a sign of increased content diversity. This study contributes to the understanding of incentive mechanisms for social media communities in the financial context.</div><br/>

<div align="justify">
    Researchers have long studied how to improve B2C e-commerce outcomes for vendors and consumers.  An implicit assumption in this work is that individuals shop online independently.  However, people often shop online with a friend or partner and buy joint goods.  We extend past research by studying collocated collaborative online shopping (COS), in which two or more shoppers communicate face-to-face and synchronously during the shopping experience.  We investigate whether recommendation agents (RAs), which have been shown to be valuable in individual shopping contexts, have similar benefits for collocated COS, and whether that value depends on the restrictiveness of the RA’s design.  RAs have the contradictory potential to both help the shoppers in their COS task and yet hinder their interaction.  We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare the effects of RAs with different levels of user-system interaction restrictiveness on both the COS process (communications) and outcomes (utilitarian and hedonic value).  Our results suggest that interactions with the RA and interactions with one’s partner are both important in COS and that the combined effects can be complex.  Flexible RAs appear to offer the best balance of partner and system effects, making COS more enjoyable and facilitating the exchange of positive social communication. Our study contributes by identifying the impact of social interactions on COS performance and demonstrating the value of process data to understand and theorize RA influence.</div><br/>
