This study uses data from a large-scale field experiment to explore how social influence operates in social advertising through examining its impact in both public (i.e., liking) and private ad responses (i.e., clicking). I estimate the effect of social cues in social ads by randomly manipulating the presence and the number of peer endorsements (i.e., friends' "likes") shown in ads among 37 million users of WeChat Moments ads. This study provides three novel findings. First, showing one "like" in an ad significantly increases users' probability to "like" and "click" the ad, indicating the effectiveness of social ads. Second, users' tendency to "like" an ad keeps increasing; yet their propensity to click an ad does not change as the number of "likes" increases from one to more. As a result, only the first social cue has significant economic value for social advertising, which is estimated for \$7.73/(1000 ad impressions). Third, this distinct growing patterns of social influence in "liking" and clicking are mainly because social influence primarily increases users' tendency to publicly endorse an ad without privately clicking it, especially when the social cues and brands in ads signal higher social status. These findings imply that advertisers should maximize the effectiveness of the first social cue shown in social ads, and that the number of peer endorsements for an ad may not indicate the amount of actual attention that the ad gains from the customers. The evidence from the post-experiment analysis also supports these implications.</div>

    Almost all the empirical evidence of a lift from social advertising focuses on a single product at a time. As a result, we know little about how social advertising effectiveness varies across products and product categories or how product characteristics impact social advertising effectiveness. We therefore collaborated with WeChat to conduct a randomized field experiment measuring social ad effectiveness across 25 product categories among a random sample of more than 37 million users of WeChat Moments Ads. We found some product categories, like food, clothes, and cars, experienced significantly stronger social advertising effectiveness than other categories like financial services and electrical appliances. More generally, we found that status goods, which rely on normative social influence, displayed strong social advertising effectiveness, while social ads for experience goods, which rely on informational social influence, did not perform any better or worse than their theoretical counterpart search goods. The status and expertise of the user displayed in the ad also moderated these effects differently across different products. Understanding the heterogeneous effects of social advertising across products will help marketers differentiate their social advertising strategies and lead researchers to a more general theory of social influence in product adoption. </div><br/>

    Peer influence is of central importance in social science. The goal of this paper is to identify subgroups where peer influence exerts enhanced effect on users' responses to social advertisements.
Our model characterizes such a subgroup using a set of interpretable rules, constructed from information regarding a user (susceptibility), his/her friend (influence), and their relationship. We present a Bayesian framework for learning a rule set. The Bayesian model consists of a prior to control the size and shape of a rule set and a Bayesian logistic regression to characterize interactions of features, treatment and subgroup membership. We also develop an efficient inference method for learning a MAP model. For this study, we partnered with a world leading mobile social network platform, WeChat, and conducted a large-scale randomized controlled field experiment on WeChat Moments (i.e., newsfeed), on more than 28 million users across 99 ads. Our model showed competitive performance and demonstrated high robustness for different types of product ads. This is the first paper on a machine learning model to identify subgroups with enhanced peer influence in social advertisements across different product categories. This study provides important insights for advertisers to increase the effectiveness of peer influence in propagating new products of different categories in social networks.</div> <br/>

    Social media not only is a new channel to obtain financial market information but also becomes the venue for investors to share and exchange investment ideas. We examine the performance consequences of providing monetary incentive to amateur analysts on social media and its implications for crowd-sourced equity research. We find that monetary incentive is effective in increasing the amount of content outputs but does not lead to better stock recommendations. Additional analysis suggests that monetary incentive results in wider stock and industry coverage, a sign of increased content diversity. This study contributes to the understanding of incentive mechanisms for social media communities in the financial context.</div><br/>

    Researchers have long studied how to improve B2C e-commerce outcomes for vendors and consumers.  An implicit assumption in this work is that individuals shop online independently.  However, people often shop online with a friend or partner and buy joint goods.  We extend past research by studying collocated collaborative online shopping (COS), in which two or more shoppers communicate face-to-face and synchronously during the shopping experience.  We investigate whether recommendation agents (RAs), which have been shown to be valuable in individual shopping contexts, have similar benefits for collocated COS, and whether that value depends on the restrictiveness of the RA’s design.  RAs have the contradictory potential to both help the shoppers in their COS task and yet hinder their interaction.  We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare the effects of RAs with different levels of user-system interaction restrictiveness on both the COS process (communications) and outcomes (utilitarian and hedonic value).  Our results suggest that interactions with the RA and interactions with one’s partner are both important in COS and that the combined effects can be complex.  Flexible RAs appear to offer the best balance of partner and system effects, making COS more enjoyable and facilitating the exchange of positive social communication. Our study contributes by identifying the impact of social interactions on COS performance and demonstrating the value of process data to understand and theorize RA influence.</div><br/>
